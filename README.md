## Java Practices by Esmond Jeng
Welcome to the Java Practices by Esmond Jeng. Here is a goup of Java examples to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Source Code Type
- `APCSA` provides you the source codes of past years of the AP Computer Science A RFP answers [here](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/free-response-questions-by-year).
- `esmond` provides the source code examples of Esmond's PPT chapters
- `HOMEWORK` are the homework projects from Ethan's high school
